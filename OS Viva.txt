 Fork system call
-The fork system is used to create new child process

 Exec system call
Exec system call is used to replace the program executed by a process

 Nice system call 
The nice( ) system call allows processes to change their base priority

 Orphan process
An orphan process are those processes that are still running even through their parent process
 has terminated or finished

 Clock function
Clock function is used To measure the time spent in a program,

 CPU Scheduling
CPU scheduling in OS is a method by which one process is allowed to use the CPU 
while the other processes are kept on hold or are kept in the waiting state.

 FCFS First Come First Serve
In this algorithm the order in which process enters th ready queue in same order they will execute on the CPU

 SJF Shortest job first
In this algorithm job will execute at the cpu according their next CPU Burst time

 PS Priority Scheduling
In this algorithm the job will execute according to their priority order

 RR Round Robin Scheduling
This algorithm gives fair chance of execution to each process in system in rotation

 Deadlock
Deadlock occurs when processes are unable to proceed because each process is waiting
 for the other process to release a resource.

 Safe state
A state is safe if the system can allocate all resources requested by all processs

Bankers algorithm is a e
Resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm which test all the request 
made by process for resources it checks for the safe state if after granting request system 
remains in the safe state it allows the request and if there is no safe state it doesn't allow the
 request made by the process

 Deadlock detection
Deadlock detection and recovery is the process of detecting and resolving deadlocks in an operating system

 Page replacement algorithm
∆ Os uses paging for memory management 
∆ page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in

 Page fault
When process requests some page during execution and that page is not available
 in physical memory then it is called page fault

 Page replacement
Page replacement in operating systems refers to the mechanism used to decide
 which page to remove from the physical memory (RAM) when a new page needs to be brought in.

 FIFO First In First Out
In this page replacement algorithm the order in which pages are loaded in memory, in same order they are replaced

 LRU Least Recently Used Replacement
This algorithm replaces that page from physical memory which is used least recently

 OPT Optimal Page Replacement
In this algorithm page will replace that from the physical memory which will not be required longer time

 A* algorithm
A*algorithm is a searching algorithm that searches for the shortest path between the initial and final state

 AO* algorithm
The AO* algorithm is based on AND-OR graphs to break complex problems into smaller ones and then solve them
